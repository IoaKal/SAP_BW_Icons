### Welcome to the PCS SAP Repository for SAP BW Icon Integration in Draw.io
*This content follows the structure of ["SAP Cloud Platform Solution Diagrams & Icons - Custom draw.io library"](https://github.com/rsletta/sap_btp_icons_drawio_lib) and ["Create SAP BTP solution diagrams with Draw.io (Diagrams.net)"](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/11/07/create-sap-btp-solution-diagrams-with-draw.io-diagrams.net/)

## What is this about?
Custom library for PCS SAP BW Icons in [Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/), based on [SAP Business Technology Platform Solution Diagrams & Icons](https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=477829554). These libraries are made for convenience and may be retracted at any time, on discretion by SAP SE. All rights reserved SAP SE.

The goal is a **SAP Business Warehouse Icon Library** to support visualization of data model. Therefore you can link your Draw.io (Diagrams.net) with cloud-based applications or like in this case â€“ with your Github repository.

A first version is already build and operational:

## How to Install and Run the Project
The first step is to consider whether to use the templates in the Draw.io desktop-application with local and manual data integration of the icon libraries, or online within the web-application and integrated lib. The former variant allows the libraries to be customized according to the user's own preferences.
 

#### Usage in Web-Applikation (Online)
For the web application, an initial link is available that includes the icons of the current state. Web-app with preinstalled BW Icons accessable via: **[PCS Template](https://app.diagrams.net/?splash=0&clibs=Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FIoaKal%2Fpcs-bw-icons%2Fmain%2FPCS_BW_Icons.xml)**

#### Usage in Desktop-Applikation (Local)
Download the Desktop-App and chose your windows installation: *[Draw.io Desktop-App](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop/releases/tag/v20.7.4)* Then the ['PCS BW Icons'](https://github.com/IoaKal/pcs-bw-icons/blob/main/PCS_BW_Icons.xml)-file must be loaded from the repository and saved locally. You can use for this the Zip-file. The file can be added to the desktop application via drag & drop. If the user saves the projects, the icon library will remain for further proceeds.

Download the latest lib here: **[ZIP-File](https://github.com/IoaKal/pcs-bw-icons/blob/main/PCS_BW_Icons.zip)** (01/23)

The library is not yet complete. As mentioned you can customize your own lib when you work within your local environment. To improve the Github repository and in particular the Repository for SAP Business Warehouse Icons for data modelling in Draw.io you can contribute by adding and updating new or existing Icons for Business Warehouse context.

- in drawio follow the path: File -> New library -> name your Library and add icons -> afterwards save
- you created a xml-file which can be shared (OneDrive, Teams etc.)
- the new file will overwrite the old file in the repository and add new icons

In order to maintain the function of the search-engine in Draw.io please pay attention and assign reasonable object names when you create Icons (e.g. for Data-Store-Object advanced: "ADSO")
