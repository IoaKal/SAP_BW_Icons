## What is this about?

Custom library for PCS SAP BW Icons in [Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/), based on [SAP Business Technology Platform Solution Diagrams & Icons](https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=477829554). These libraries are made for convenience and may be retracted at any time, on discretion by SAP SE. All rights reserved SAP SE.

The BTP template in a web application can be reached via:
**[Template with SAP BTP Icons](https://app.diagrams.net/?splash=0&clibs=Uhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/mauriciolauffer/sap_btp_icons_drawio_lib/main/libs/SAP_BTP_Service_Icons_latest.xml)**

## How to Install and Run the Project
The first step is to consider whether to use the templates in the Draw.io desktop-application with local and manual data integration of the icon libraries, or online within the web-application and integrated lib. The former variant allows the libraries to be customized according to the user's own preferences.
 

#### Usage in Web-Applikation (Online)
For the web application, an initial link is available that includes the icons of the current state.

Web-app with preinstalled BW Icons accessable via: **[PCS Template](https://app.diagrams.net/?splash=0&clibs=Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FIoaKal%2Fpcs-bw-icons%2Fmain%2FPCS_BW_Icons.xml)**

#### Usage in Desktop-Applikation (Local)
Download the Desktop-App and chose your windows installation: **[Draw.io Desktop-App](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop/releases/tag/v20.7.4)**

First the "PCS BW Icons" file must be loaded from the repository and saved locally. You can use for this the Zip-file. Then the file can be added to the desktop application via drag & drop. If the user saves the projects, the icon library will remain for further proceeds.
