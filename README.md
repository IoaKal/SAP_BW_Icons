Custom library for PCS SAP BW Icons in [Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/), based on [SAP Business Technology Platform Solution Diagrams & Icons](https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=477829554).

## How to Install and Run the Project
the first step is to consider whether to use the Draw.io desktop-app with local and manual data integration of the icon libraries or online with the web-app. The former variant allows the libraries to be customized according to the user's own preferences.

### Usage in Web-Applikation (Online)
For the web application, an initial link is available that includes the icons of the current state.

Web-app with preinstalled BW Icons accessable via: [PCS Template](https://app.diagrams.net/?splash=0&clibs=Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FIoaKal%2FSAP_BW_Icons%2Fmain%2FPCS_BW_Icons.xml%3Ftoken%3DGHSAT0AAAAAAB5C44T4DI6CJYQOQDX7OUO2Y6GYWLA)

### Usage in Desktop-Applikation (Local)
First, the "PCS BW Icons" file must be loaded from the repository and saved locally. Then the file can be added to the desktop application via drag & drop. If the project is saved, the icon library remains.
